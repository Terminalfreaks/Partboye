# Partboye

A partition manager that doesn't actually work.  
Wait.. what? The hell is that supposed to mean?  

Well the point of this is to mimick one from the command line as closely as possible without actually doing partitioning.

### But why?
Honestly I don't know I'm bored lul

## Installation

Download the script in the bin/ folder.  
????  
Run it (probably only works on linux)  

If you are on any other platform you can build the project yourself on Crystal.  
Just install it at <https://crystal-lang.org/install/>, download the repo and run `shards build` (in the directory).  
Congrats, you now built an executable! Run it. It should be in the bin directory.

## Usage

Run `partboye`. Now you will be in its interactive shell.
